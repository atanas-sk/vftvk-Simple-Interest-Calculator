Hello, thank you for reviewing my project! I hope I have accomplished the task in a organised and presentable way.

Note:Interest Rate <input type="range" max="21"> - I have put 21 as max range based on the position of the slider in the screenshot example.

                     
I wish you all the best
Atanas
